# Decremental and Fully Dynamic k-2-Hop-Cover for k-Shortest Paths problem
This is the implementation of DEC-kPLL and FUL-kPLL algorithms used for the experimental part of manuscript title "On Mining Dynamic Graphs for $k$ Shortest Paths", submitted for publication to the ASONAM 2024.

The code is inspired by the implementation of T. Akiba https://github.com/iwiwi/top-k-pruned-landmark-labeling

The current implementation is built on the Networkit library https://github.com/networkit/networkit
