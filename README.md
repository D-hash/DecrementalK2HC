# Decremental and Fully Dynamic k-2-Hop-Cover for k-Shortest Paths problem
This is the implementation of DEC-kPLL and FUL-kPLL algorithms used for the experimental part of manuscript title "Extracting ùëò Shortest Paths from Very Large Dynamic Graphs", submitted for publication to the 50th International Conference on Very Large Databases (VLDB 2024).

The code is inspired by the implementation of Akiba https://github.com/iwiwi/top-k-pruned-landmark-labeling

The current implementation requires Networkit library https://github.com/networkit/networkit
