# Decremental and Fully Dynamic k-2-Hop-Cover for k-Shortest Paths problem
This is the implementation of DEC-kPLL and FUL-kPLL algorithms presented in "Extracting 𝑘 Shortest Paths from Very Large Dynamic Graphs" submitted at Very Large Database (VLDB) conference 2024.

The code is inspired by the implementation of Akiba https://github.com/iwiwi/top-k-pruned-landmark-labeling

The current implementation requires Networkit library https://github.com/networkit/networkit
